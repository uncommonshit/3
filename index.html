                <p>Justin Beaver has confessed something that even his greatest fans would have never expected of the
                    skilled musician and lyricist. The young rock-and-roller admitted that since he typed his first
                    title tag, his life became easier. It has been reported by those surrounding the Canadian that
                    Beaver's private mentors, Ryan Loseling and Nicholas Crate, often walk around Los Angeles disputing
                    what a great tool the HTML validator is.</p>

                <p>Beaver has already created some websites and does not intend to stop there. <q>I will probably have a
                        song about HTML on my next album,</q> - the artist added.
